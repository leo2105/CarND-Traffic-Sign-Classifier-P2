    "As a first step, I decided to convert the images to grayscale because of the complexity of the model. We can use a model for RGB images but it would take a lot of time. Another thing, in this dataset we prefer to take in consideration the shape of the sign traffics instead of color.\n",

    "#### 3. Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train the model, I used an my CPU and GPU of AWS. I did first iterations on my CPU because I put only 10 iterations. When I thought this model would be great I ran on GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried with a batch size equal to 100 and only 60 epochs. It worked well. I had overfitting and underfitting with 256, 512 or 50 of batch size. It took only 60 epochs because, if I use more epochs It gives overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "I use Adam optimizer because It combines Adagrad and SGD method in some way and I do not have to put the *learning decay* like hyperparameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used to use learning rate equal to 1e-3, but accuracy was too low. So, I decided to put 5e-4 or 9e-4 and it worked better.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "My final model results were:\n",
    "* training set accuracy of 100%\n",
    "* validation set accuracy of 95.7%\n",
    "* test set accuracy of 94.9%\n",
    "\n",
    "If an iterative approach was chosen:\n",
    "* What was the first architecture that was tried and why was it chosen?\n",
    "    - The first architecture was LeNet just modifying the last layer, 43 classes instead of 10.\n",
    "    - The model was implemented on the notebook.\n",
    "* What were some problems with the initial architecture?\n",
    "    - For digits, LeNet works well, but we need to make an architecture for traffic signs. I just added some neurons and change hyperparameters and I got good results.\n",
    "* How was the architecture adjusted and why was it adjusted? Typical adjustments could include choosing a different model architecture, adding or taking away layers (pooling, dropout, convolution, etc), using an activation function or changing the activation function. One common justification for adjusting an architecture would be due to overfitting or underfitting. A high accuracy on the training set but low accuracy on the validation set indicates over fitting; a low accuracy on both sets indicates under fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - I was modifying the model because there was an under fitting. A convolutional layer was placed instead of the first fully-connected layer. \n",
    "    - To avoid over-fitting, the dropout regularization method was added between the two fully connected layers. \n",
    "    - Thanks to this modification, 94% accuracy was achieved in the validation data.\n",
    "* Which parameters were tuned? How were they adjusted and why?\n",
    "    - Kernel size. 5x5 instead of 3x3 in every convolutional layer. To get another image processing or filter for training set images. \n",
    "sabemos que filtros mas pequenos nos da detalles mas finos de las imagenes, pero con filtro mas grandes quizas quitamos detalles irrelevantes. \n",
    "    - Learning rate equal to 0.0009. I changed because the loss was increasing after some epochs. I decided to reduce learning rate to keep decreasing the loss.\n",
    "    - Neurons of FC layers was 400-120-84-43. I changed to 800-43. For reducing the complexity of the model and have more neurons where to classify.\n",
    "    - I have changed batch size to 100. I have tried with 128, 256, 512 , 50. But, 100 give me better results and it is faster than others.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* What are some of the important design choices and why were they chosen? For example, why might a convolution layer work well with this problem? How might a dropout layer help with creating a successful model?\n",
    "    - Dropout layer helped me to avoid over fitting. I use keep_prob equal to 0.5\n",
    "    - I think the most important thing was changing first FC by Convolutional layer and adding a flattened Pooling layer to first FC.\n",
    "    \n",
    "If a well known architecture was chosen:\n",
    "* What architecture was chosen?\n",
    "    - Model from Sermanet and LeCun paper (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/sermanet-ijcnn-11.pdf).\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Why did you believe it would be relevant to the traffic sign application?\n",
    "    - In the paper of Yann LeCun, they say that their model achieved almost 100% of precision. I think this model is a best way to start better traffic sign classifier.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* How does the final model's accuracy on the training, validation and test set provide evidence that the model is working well?\n",
    "    - Accuracy on the training is 100%, Validation 95.8% and Test 94.9%. These are good results and I proved on 6 Internet Images. \n",
